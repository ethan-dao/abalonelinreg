# abalonelinreg

This linear regression project was done for my final project for Stats 101A (Linear Regression). On a dataset consisting of abalone weight, size, etc. at birth, I performed a linear regression model to predict abalone age. The main problem I faced was multicollinearity, as lots of the variables were very similar to each other. I had to perform a log transform on my predictors and in the end, was able to get more information on my chosen predictor variables.
